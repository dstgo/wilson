    # These unchecked errors can be critical bugs in some cases.

    # Linter for Go source code that specializes in simplifying code.
    - gosimple
    # Vet examines Go source code and reports suspicious constructs.
    # It is roughly the same as 'go vet' and uses its passes.
    - govet
    # Finds wasted assignment statements.
    - staticcheck
    - wastedassign
    # Check for pass []any as any in variadic func(...any).
    - asasalint
    # Checks that all code identifiers does not have non-ASCII symbols in the name.
    - asciicheck
    # Checks for dangerous Unicode character sequences.

  # The formats used to render issues.
  # Formats:
  # - `colored-line-number`
  # - `line-number`

  # Output path can be either `stdout`, `stderr` or path to the file to write to.
  #
  # For the CLI flag (`--out-format`), multiple formats can be specified by separating them by comma.
  # The output can be specified for each of them by separating format name and path by colon symbol.
  # Example: "--out-format=checkstyle:report.xml,json:stdout,colored-line-number"
  # The CLI flag (`--out-format`) override the configuration file.

  # to go.mod are needed. This setting is most useful to check that go.mod does
  # not need updates, such as in a continuous integration and testing system.
  # If invoked with -mod=vendor, the go command assumes that the vendor

  # Mainly related to generics support since go1.18.

  # Number of operating system threads (`GOMAXPROCS`) that can execute golangci-lint simultaneously.

  #
  # If severity rules are defined and the issues do not match or no severity is provided to the rule
